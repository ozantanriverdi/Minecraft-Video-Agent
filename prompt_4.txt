#### **Guidance for your task:**

{guidance}

---

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Observation and Detailed Analysis:**
   - You will receive observations as **RGB images**.
   - Carefully analyze each image to understand your surroundings.
   - **Identify and list all notable objects** in the scene (e.g., cows, trees, enemies, structures).
   - **Estimate the distance** to each object you identify, using qualitative descriptions (e.g., "close", "far", "immediate vicinity", "in the distance").
   - **Provide a detailed description** of the environment, including spatial relationships between objects.

2. **Action Planning:**
   - Based on your detailed analysis, think of valid actions that will help you achieve your task.
   - Plan efficient sequences of actions that directly contribute to accomplishing your objective.

3. **Action Format:**
   - The actions you return must follow a specific template.
   - **Each action** is an **8-tuple** of discrete values.
   - **Action Vector Example:** `[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0]`

4. **Action Index Descriptions:**

   - **Index 0**: **Forward and backward movement**
     - `0`: No movement
     - `1`: Move forward
     - `2`: Move backward

   - **Index 1**: **Move left and right**
     - `0`: No movement
     - `1`: Move left
     - `2`: Move right

   - **Index 2**: **Jump, sneak, and sprint**
     - `0`: No action
     - `1`: Jump
     - `2`: Sneak
     - `3`: Sprint

   - **Index 3**: **Camera delta pitch (vertical angle)**
     - Values range from `0` (looking up) to `24` (looking down)
     - `12` represents looking straight ahead

   - **Index 4**: **Camera delta yaw (horizontal rotation)**
     - Values range from `0` (turning left by 180 degrees) to `24` (turning right by 180 degrees)
     - `12` represents no turn

   - **Index 5**: **Functional actions**
     - `0`: No action
     - `1`: Use (e.g., right-click)
     - `2`: Drop
     - `3`: Attack (e.g., left-click)
     - `4`: Craft
     - `5`: Equip
     - `6`: Place
     - `7`: Destroy

   - **Index 6**: **Argument for 'craft'**
     - Values from `0` to `243`, representing different craftable items

   - **Index 7**: **Argument for 'equip', 'place', and 'destroy'**
     - Values from `0` to `35`, representing inventory slot indices

5. **Response Format:**
   - **First**, provide your detailed observations and analysis of the RGB image.
     - **List the objects** you detect and their estimated distances.
     - **Describe the environment** and any relevant spatial relationships.
   - **Then**, return your actions as a **list** of action vectors.
   - **Do not** include any additional text, explanations, or formatting after the action vectors.
   - **Example Format:**

     ```
     **Observations:**

     - I see a cow in the middle distance ahead.
     - There is a tree nearby on the left.
     - An enemy (zombie) is far away to the right.

     **Environment Description:**

     - The terrain is mostly flat with grass.
     - The cow is approximately 20 blocks ahead.
     - The tree is about 5 blocks to the left.
     - The zombie is moving slowly towards me from a distance.

     **Actions:**

     [[1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 1, 0, 0]]
     ```

#### **Examples:**

1. **Approaching a Cow and Collecting Milk:**

   - **Observations:**

     - A cow is directly ahead at a close distance.
     - No other mobs or obstacles are nearby.

   - **Environment Description:**

     - The area is open with grassy terrain.
     - The cow is approximately 10 blocks ahead.

   - **Actions:**

     ```
     [[1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 1, 0, 0]]
     ```

2. **Finding a Tree and Collecting Wood:**

   - **Observation and Reasoning:**

     ```
     There is a tree ahead. I can collect wood by moving forward and attacking the tree.
     ```

   - **Action:**

     ```
     [[1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0]]
     ```

3. **Avoiding an Enemy:**

   - **Observation and Reasoning:**

     ```
     I see an enemy approaching from the left. I should move right to avoid it.
     ```

   - **Action:**

     ```
     [[0, 2, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0]]
