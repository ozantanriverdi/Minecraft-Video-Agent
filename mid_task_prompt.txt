#### **Guidance for your task:**
1. If the cow is not in front of you, first rotate to the cow.
2. After the cow is in the middle of the screen start moving towards the cow by going forward.
3. hen you are close enough, bend forward with "[0, 0, 0, 15, 12, 0, 0, 0]"
4. Then use the action "[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 1, 0, 0]" to collect milk.

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Observation and Detailed Analysis:**
   - You will receive observations as **RGB images**.
   - Carefully analyze the image to ensure that the cow is visible.

2. **Action Format:**
   - The actions you return must follow a specific template.
   - **Each action** is an **8-tuple** of discrete values.
   - **Action Vector Example:** `[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0]`
   - **Finally**, return your actions as a **list** of action vectors.

#### **Example Responses:**

1. **Milking a Cow When Not Facing It:**

   - **Observations:**

     - A cow is ahead to the right at a far distance.

   - **Environment Description:**

     - The cow is approximately 20 blocks away and 60 degrees to the right.
     - The area is open grassland.

   - **Reasoning:**

     - Turn right to face the cow.
     - Move forward to get closer to the cow.
     - Once within interaction range, use the bucket to milk the cow.

   - **Actions:**

     ```
     [[0, 0, 0, 12, 20, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 15, 12, 0, 0, 0]
      [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 1, 0, 0]]
     ```
