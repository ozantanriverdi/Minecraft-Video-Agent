You are a language model assisting in filtering a list of conference paper titles specifically related to spatial understanding and its evaluation, regardless of whether the environment is virtual or real-world.

---

**List of article titles:**

{articles}

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Objective**: Identify any article title(s) in the provided list that discuss or indicate research involving:

- Spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, or spatial relationships

- Evaluation, testing, or benchmarking of models or agents on spatial concepts (e.g., distance, orientation, layout comprehension)

- This includes both real-world and virtual (e.g., simulated, game-based) settings

2. **Exclusions**:

- Exclude papers focused solely on unrelated modalities (e.g., general language modeling or vision tasks) without a spatial component

- Exclude reinforcement learning papers unless spatial understanding or reasoning is a central focus

- Exclude papers about generating images or videos.

3. You will receive each article's title.

4. Only include articles about techniques for improving the spatial understanding performance of VLMs.

5. Response Format:

- Return the output as a JSON-formatted list where each title is paired with a boolean value.

- The boolean value should be true if the article appears to study spatial understanding or its evaluation. Otherwise, return false.

**Example Response**:
```json
[
    {{"title": "Evaluating LLMs on Spatial Reasoning Across Tasks", "relevant": true}},
    {{"title": "Unsupervised Speech Recognition with Transformers", "relevant": false}},
    {{"title": "Learning 3D Layouts from Multi-View Images", "relevant": true}}
