Analyze the provided image and determine the relative direction of the {entity_2} with respect to the {entity_1}.

Use your real world knowledge about perspective and depth to make the prediction.

Answer the following 3 questions:

### Question 1:

Is the {entity_2} on the left, on the right of {entity_1} or at the same level?

### Response 1:

- -1 means {entity_2} is on the left of {entity_1}
- 0 means {entity_2} is on the same level as {entity_1}
- 1 means {entity_2} is on the right of {entity_1}

### Question 2:

Is the {entity_2} above, below {entity_1} or at the same level?

### Response 2:

- -1 means {entity_2} is above {entity_1}
- 0 means {entity_2} is on the same level as {entity_1}
- 1 means {entity_2} is below {entity_1}

### Question 3:

Is the {entity_2} behind of, in front of {entity_1} or at the same level?

### Response 3:

- -1 means {entity_2} is behind {entity_1}
- 0 means {entity_2} is on the same level as {entity_1}
- 1 means {entity_2} is in front of {entity_1}

### Response Format:

```json
{{ 
    "direction": "[<Response_1>, <Response_2>, <Response_3>]"
}}
```

### Example:

**Input: Image 1:** [Sheep is to the left, above and behind the cow]  
**Output:**

```json
{{ 
    "direction": "[-1, -1, -1]"
}}
```

### Rules:
- For each question, only consider one dimension at a time
- Always return your response in JSON format.
- Don't add additional comments into the json.
- The value in json must be a list of length 3 with 3 possible values (-1, 0, 1).

Now, analyze the given image and determine the relative direction.
