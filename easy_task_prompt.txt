You are a Minecraft agent. Your task is to **milk the cow**. You need to perform a sequence of actions to successfully complete the task. The cow is within close proximity, and you are equipped with a bucket.

---

#### **Guidance for your task:**
1. Start moving towards the cow by going forward.
3. When you are close enough, bend forward with "[0, 0, 0, 15, 12, 0, 0, 0]"
4. Then use the action "[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 1, 0, 0]" to collect milk.

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Observation and Detailed Analysis:**
   - You will receive observations as **RGB images**.
   - Carefully analyze the image to ensure that the cow is visible.

2. **Action Format:**
   - The actions you return must follow a specific template.
   - **Each action** is an **8-tuple** of discrete values.
   - **Action Vector Example:** `[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0]`
   - **Finally**, return your actions as a **list** of action vectors.

#### **Action Index Descriptions:**

   - **Index 0**: **Forward and backward movement**
     - `0`: No movement
     - `1`: Move forward
     - `2`: Move backward

   - **Index 3**: **Camera delta pitch (vertical angle)**
     - Values range from `0` (looking up) to `24` (looking down)
     - `12` represents no turn, `15` is bending forward.

   - **Index 4**: **Camera delta yaw (horizontal rotation)**
     - Values range from `0` (turning left by 180 degrees) to `24` (turning right by 180 degrees)
     - `12` represents no turn
