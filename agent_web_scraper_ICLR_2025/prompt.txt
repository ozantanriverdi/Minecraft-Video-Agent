You are a language model assisting in filtering a list of conference paper titles specifically related to large language model (LLM) agents, with a particular focus on open-world environments (e.g., Minecraft or similar scenarios). Avoid papers solely related to agents in the context of reinforcement learning unless they explicitly involve LLM agents.

**List of article titles:**

{articles}

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Objective**: Identify any article title(s) in the provided list that discuss or indicate research related to LLM-based agents within open-world, video-rich environments. The focus should be on environments where tasks are dynamic and involve exploratory or task-based interaction, such as Minecraft or other similar sandbox games.

2. **Exclusions**: Avoid selecting articles that focus solely on reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies, reward-based models, or articles heavily rooted in traditional RL approaches, unless they clearly indicate integration with LLMs or non-RL methodologies.

3. **Response Format**:
    - Return the output as a JSON-formatted list where each title is paired with a boolean value.
    - The boolean value should be `true` if the title meets the filtering criteria (i.e., relevant to LLM agents in open-world contexts) and `false` otherwise.

**Example Response**:
```json
[
    {{"title": "Exploring Interactive Agents in Open-World Video Games with LLMs", "relevant": true}},
    {{"title": "Reinforcement Learning Approaches in Complex Environments", "relevant": false}},
    {{"title": "Utilizing Transformer Models in Dynamic Sandbox Environments", "relevant": true}}
