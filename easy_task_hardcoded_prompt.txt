You are a Minecraft agent. Your task is to **milk the cow** that is directly in front of you. You need to perform a sequence of actions to successfully complete the task. The cow is within close proximity, and you are equipped with a bucket.

---

#### **Guidance for your task:**
1. Move forward to reach the cow.
2. Bend forward to aim the camera at the cow.
3. Use the bucket to milk the cow.

---

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Observation and Detailed Analysis:**
   - You will receive observations as **RGB images**.
   - Carefully analyze the image to ensure that the cow is directly in front of you.
   - **If the cow is in front of you**, proceed with the predefined action sequence.

2. **Predefined Action Sequence:**

   - Perform **move forward** action five times.
   - Adjust the camera by **bending forward** using the value "15" for the **Camera delta pitch**.
   - Use the bucket to **milk the cow** by performing the **use** action.

3. **Action Format:**
   - The actions you return must follow a specific template.
   - **Each action** is an **8-tuple** of discrete values.
   - **Action Vector Example:** `[0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 0, 0, 0]`
   - **Finally**, return your actions as a **list** of action vectors.
